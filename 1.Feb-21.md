# Meeting Notes February 21
* We decided to go with our alarm clark application where someone has to play a game in order to turn it off
* Have a hangman game where only a few letters are available so that it will look more fluid without needing to include every character of the alphabet
* Focused on writing the information for Milestone 1, which can be found in the milestones repository
* We discussed why we are choosing agile methodology
    * We are still learning the technology so we want to remain flexible
    * It is a very modern take on development and we want to learn modern skillsets
* We discussed the plan for dealing with unresponsive teammates
    * We will ask our TA about if one of the group members is still in class
* We created an architecture diagram and discussed what will happen if the computer goes to sleep (will the alarm still function?)
* We completed the Milestone 1 document
