# Meeting Notes April 11th

* Discussed completion of tasks over the last week
  * Implementing the alarm
  * Integrating the settings page with the server
  * Creating several of the API pages after completing the alarm
  * Scoreboard - still missing
* Discussed how to properly add sound to the alarm
  * Difficulty with sound being allowed to automatically play at page load
  * This can be overcome by using Firefox and changing one of the settings in the browser
  * Maybe there is a better way, but this will be the MVP
* Determined how the pages should interact with each other
  * Once the user logs in or registers, they are taken to the alarm
  * After setting an alarm, when the alarm goes off, the user will be redirected to the API page
  * The API page will have several buttons such as going back to the alarm, viewing scoreboard, or changing settings
  * Each button will redirect to a new page, and these pages have a navigation bar at the top for getting back
* Completed Milestone 5
  * Tests for the alarm, login, api, etc.
* Discussed tasks for the next week
  * Continuing work on the alarm
  * Adding score and zip code to users
  * Completing additional APIs and making the correct ones load based on user settings
  * Complete scoreboard page
